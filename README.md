Week 6 of the Craft Academy course, we are creating our own ideas with the knowledge that we have aquired so far.
From creating and idea through planning and implementation. The aim is to include an API, user registration and more.

```
gem 'rails'
gem 'devise'
```

And for testing the implementation 

```
gem 'cucumber-rails'
gem 'rspec-rails'
```
